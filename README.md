# react-sans-create-react-app
This repository contains a React app template and a step by step guide for making it.

The template is located in [template](https://github.com/olav35/react-sans-create-react-app/tree/template).

The guide is split into different steps located in separate branches listed below. The guide's purpose is to be a concise reference of https://fullstackopen.com/en/part7/webpack for me. If you want to learn this I suggest you read the guide there.
